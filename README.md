# LangEduc
## Introduction: ##
Hi everyone! I and my friend Marcos @marcostx7 are Brazilian High-School students doing an internship at SashiDo.

First of all, we are going to talk about our idea. Our project is called LangEduc, which is an abbreviation of the words "Language" and "Education". Basically, this project aims to help children to learn other languages, especially English. In Brazil, toddlers have lots of difficulties learning English, mostly because the educational system here is very theoretical and does not encourage children to learn English as well as other foreign languages dynamically.

Before developing the project, we made lots of searches and found out that toddlers can learn languages easily if they learn with images. Thus, we had the idea to develop an application using Teachable Machine, to make it easier for children to have their first contact with foreign languages and start their learning, something that will be very important if they decide to actually study deeply the chosen language.
