# LangEduc
Hi everyone! I and my friend Marcos @marcostx7 are Brazilian High-School students doing an internship at SashiDo.

## What is this project? ##
This project is called LangEduc because we intend to teach laguages with it. "LangEduc" is an abbreviation of the words "Language" and "Education". Basically, this project aims to help children to learn other languages, especially English. However, in this version we also teach portuguese and spanish using the features implemented in the web-application. In Brazil, people in general, but especially toddlers have lots of difficulties learning English, mostly because the educational system here is very theoretical and does not encourage children to learn English as well as other foreign languages dynamically.

For develop LangEduc, we studied a lot and found out that toddlers can learn languages easily if they learn with images. Thus, we had the idea to develop an application using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image), to make it easier for children to have their first contact with foreign languages and start their learning, something that will be very important if they decide to actually study deeply the chosen language.

We would like to say that we tried to develop a simple application in order to make it easier for beginners to get in contact with the main programming languages as well as with [SashiDo](https://www.sashido.io/en/), a company that provides a very great back-end support to any project you have in mind.

Therefore, if you just learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript, we think that this project could be very interesting to you as a beginner, both for using and learning with it, as well as exploring the code and trying to develop your own project based on what we did here.
